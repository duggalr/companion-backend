Part A: Saving for a House
You have just graduated from MIT and have a job! You move to the Bay Area and decide that you want to start saving for a home. Houses are fairly
expensive, so you start saving up for the down payment on your dream home.
Your goal is to find the number of months it takes to save up for a down payment. The cost of your down payment is calculated by multiplying the
total cost of your dream house by the down payment percentage.
- You will be given a function with the following variables.
. The starting yearly salary ( yearly_salary)
. The portion of salary to be saved ( portion_saved). This variable should be in decimal form (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).
. The cost of your dream home ( cost_of_dream_home)

You will need to determine how many months it will take given the following information:
. yearly_salary, as described above.
. portion_saved, as described above.
. cost_of_dream_home, as described above.
. portion_down_payment, the percentage of the total cost needed for a down payment. Assume portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).
. The amount that you have saved thus far is amount_saved, which starts at $0.
. You get an annual rate of return r. In other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional amount_saved * (r/12) funds for your
savings (the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume r = 0.05 (5%).
. At the end of each month, your savings increase by (1) a percentage of your monthly salary and (2) the monthly return on your investment. (Note:
The investment amount used to calculate the monthly return is the amount you had saved at the start of each month.)
Output:
. Your program should store the number of months required to save for the down payment using a variable called months.
Notes:
- Be careful about values that represent annual amounts versus monthly amounts.
- If the number of months your program returns is off by one, reread the highlighted text above.
- Your program should print outputs in the same format as the test cases below. If you're using Spyder, you might see extra lines in between
outputs. Don't worry about them!
